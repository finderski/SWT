# Savage Worlds Tabbed Character Sheet\r\r

### Now with International Language Support!!\r\r

## Character Sheet\r\r

* The Character Sheet view can be toggled between Wild Card and Mook using the button in the upper left-hand corner (default is Wild Card)\r
* The Mook sheet and the Wild Card sheet are the same sheet, thus allowing universal macros; selecting a character sheet as a Mook will prevent it from rolling a Wild Die when using the buttons on the sheet.
* The banner indicates type of character the sheet is for (Mook vs. Wild Card, unless changed on the Game Settings page)
* The sheet now has a Stat Block button that will whisper the entire stat block of the character to the Chat windowâ€”this stat block includes Ability Command Buttons so rolls can be made directly from the Chat window.\r
* The sheet has a configuration section so it can be tweaked to fit the Setting being played\r\r

## Configuration\r\r

To configure the sheet to meet your needs, click the Gear icon. In the configuration section you can:\r\r

* Configure Initiative modifying Edges for the DealInit API Script\r
* Indicate the character has certain rule altering edges (such as Nerves of Steel or Fleet-Footed)\r
* Change the UI in the **UI Tweaks** section\r
  * Select a Background for the sheet\r
  * Select a Logo to match your setting\r
  * Choose a Roll Template for Trait & Damage rolls\r
  * Elect to show dice icons instead of drop down menus.\r
     - This feature is only available for Attributes, Skills, and the Wild Die.\r
     - The enhanced Trait Die Type Drop Down Menu uses the same field names as the regular drop downs, which introduces a risk for potential data loss. To minimize risk use only the standard textual drop down menu OR make periodic notations of all Trait ranks.\r
         + **NOTE:** I've not experienced any problems (except with repeating sections, which is why this hasn't been implemented there yet. But, fair warning.\r
  * Hide the Arcanum tab (shown by default)\r
  * Show Vehicle tab (hidden by default)\r
  * Choose a handwriting font for the Quest Log\r
* Configure the sheet with various Game Settings\r
     - Quick Settings\r
         + Allows you click a supported setting and all the appropriate fields for that setting will automatically be selected for the character sheet.\r
     - Show additional Stats and Fields\r
     - Replace field names with setting specific ones\r
* Configure Optional & Home Brew Rules\r
     - Variable Bonus Damage die type: This allows you to change the standard d6 bonus to something different for people who increase the die type for each additional Raise achieved on the Trait roll\r
     - Choose to not use Power Points\r
     - Option for Skill Specialization\r
     - Roll for extra XP for unspent Bennies\r\r

## Attributes & Skills\r\r

* Skills (Wild Card and Mook)\r
    - All skills from the Savage Worlds Core Deluxe rules are included in the sheet, but are hidden by default. To manage them, click on the \"+/- Core Skills\" button on the Skills tab (right above Fighting) and place a check mark next to each skill you'd like to use.\r
    - The sheet supports the optional Skill Specialization rule. To manage this, click on the \"+/- Core Skills\" button on the Skills tab (right above Fighting) and place a check mark next to \"Use Skill Specialization\"\r
    - Fencing Styles and Schools are supported. click on the \"+/- Core Skills\" button on the Skills tab (right above Fighting) and place a check mark next to \"Fencing Styles & Schools\"\r
* All Trait dice are limited to the standard d4-d12 dice. To accommodate certain Edges that allow one to have a trait die type that has a permanent modifier (ie Professional, Woodsman, etc.) use the modifier box to the right of each Trait die type.\r
* You can mouse over just about any field to get its attribute name.\r
* All field titles follow Roll20's attribute syntax, ie. Agility would be displayed as \"@{agility}\" on mouse-over.\r\r

## The Wild Die\r\r

* The Wild Die is a configurable field to allow for Edges (such as Master) that may alter the Wild Die.\r\r

## Rolls\r\r

* You can mouse over any button to get its ability name.\r
* Roll button titles DO NOT follow Roll20's ability syntax, using the selected token, ie. \"%{selected|STR-check}\", but will only show the attribute displayed like \"@{AgilityRoll}\".\r
* The gm button uses the exact same formula for rolling as the regular button, but will whisper the roll to the GM.\r\r

## Additional Notes\r\r

* Most Repeating Sections have a \"Hide Macro Formula\" checkbox. Unchecking it will reveal a formula you can use to create macros that simulate the roll buttons in that repeating section.\r
* Apply Encumbrance Checkbox (in the skills sections) can be checked to automatically apply any Encumbrance Penalties to a particular skill roll. The standard skills already care for this automatically.\r
* If there's something you want added, or you'd like to report a bug, please contact Finderski in the \"Character Sheets\" forum (putting Savage Worlds in the title will help me notice the post more readily, but isn't strictly necessary).\r\r
