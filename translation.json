	"cog-explanation": "Any place you see the cog icon, you can congfigure that item. In most places the cog is hidden until you hover over the configurable item; clicking the cog will force it to remain visible until clicked again.",
	"hide-n-show-explanation": "These two icons hide and show (respectively) the given section.",
	"intro-p3v1": "This sheet includes all the necessary core data for a Savage Worlds character, but leverages the unique capabilities of Roll20. The sheet auto-calculates, Parry and Toughness and a few other setting specific/game expanding derived stats like Strain (cyberpunk) or Sanity (horror). Additionally, this sheet includes every skill from the <em>Savage Worlds Deluxe</em> and <em>Savage Worlds Adventure Edition</em> Core rules; there are also a few popular skills, such as Faith, Guts, etc.",
	"maincv-p1v1": "The Main Character View page contains the information that will be used mostly frequently. Here, you can: indicate whether the character is a Wild Card or an Extra, track your advances, manage your Attributes and Skills, etc.",
	"maincv-p2v1": "All five attributes have a drop down menu to select the die rank and a modifier field. The &#34;always&#34; visible modifier field counts as part of the attribute rank—this means the field will usually be 0, but certain Edges can modify that. Each attribute can also be configured to Whisper the roll to the GM and also provides another modifier box; this second modifier field is really for Edges/Hindrances that may always modify a given attribute, but is not considered part of the rank.",
	"maincv-p3v1": "If the Attribute section is &#34;hidden&#34; a list of buttons will replace it; there is a button for each of the Core Attributes along with the current rank.",
	"maincv-p4v1": "The layout of the skills is identical to the Attributes section in terms of managing the Rank and modifier fields. There are a couple key differences, however.",
	"maincv-p5v1": "One of the key differences is how to show each skill. Clicking the <span class=&#34;sheet-pictos&#34;>x</span> icon will reveal the Skills Configuration panel. Here you can select optional rules, such as using Skill Specialization and/or Fencing styles and schoosl, and you can, also, select which skills to show on the character sheet. Fighting is shown by default, it's a skill that's used quite frequently and is necessary for calculating Parry. Selecting &#34;All&#34; will check all the skills to be shown, selecting &#34;Core Skills&#34; will show the <em>Savage Worlds Adventure Edition</em> Core skills (Athletics, Common Knowledge, Notice, Persuasion, and Stealth). When you're done configuring your skills, click the green <span class=&#34;sheet-pictos&#34;>2<span> to close the panel.",
	"maincv-p6v1": "Starting with Version 3.0 of this sheet, support for other conditions (e.g. Distracted, Vulnerable, and Stunned) is included.  Any penalties to rolls as a result of these conditions is automatically accounted for in rolls made from the sheet. For great flexibility, the sheet allows you to set the maximum Wound and Fatigue levels; hoving over each field will show the configuration cog.",
	"maincv-p7-v1": "The Core Derived stats (Pace, Parry, Toughness) automatically calculate based on the various inputs.  For example, Parry will take the Fighting rank and determine the Base Parry score. Adding any sort of modifiers will then be taken into consideration and the final score will appear in the current column.",
	"maincv-p8-v1": "<strong>A Note on Toughness:</strong> The Toughness score is calculated per the book in terms of the Base. The Current column also includes any armor worn, however, it is only worn armor that covers the Torso; this is because non-called shots automatically target the Torso (per the rules).",
	"maincv-p9-v1": "Melee and Ranged weapons have been combined into a single section. This should help with keeping the clutter down, but also keep all the weapons in a single place, allowing for easier management.  It also makes it easier for a weapon that is both Melee and Ranged to be documented in one place.",
	"maincv-p10-v1": "Each weapon can be configured to whisper the roll(s) to the GM, as well as modify what the roll button does.  The roll button can be set up to roll damage only, or Attack and Damage (Atk + Dmg). If you set the button to roll Attack and Damage, a drop down menu will be shown where you can select which skill will be rolled for the Attack the Roll. You can also configure the damage to use any of the Core Attributes (thought it defaults to Strength). The modifier field on the damage is a text box instead of a number field for flexibility. For example, if you have a wepon that does Str + d4 + d6, you'd select Strength, place a 1 in the field before the die type, select the appropriate die type, and in the modifier field you'd type 1d6!.",
	"maincv-p11-v1": "<strong>Note:</strong> While it's not here yet, support will be forth coming to allow a different Bonus Damage die to be rolled instead of the standard d6.",
	"maincv-p12-v1": "Powers have the same configuration options as Weapons; the skill selection drop down menu only contains Arcane skills, however.",
	"config-p1v1": "The configuration window allows the GM and Player a little more control over various aspects of the character sheet. One can tweak the User Interface slightly by changing the Logo or the Background image.
